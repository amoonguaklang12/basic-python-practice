PythonBank explores the financial records of a fictional company. The dataset contained in [budget_data.csv] is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Using Python, I calculated:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PythonPoll containes fictional ballots casted by voters for different candidates. The dataset contained in [election_data.csv] is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

Using Python, I calculated:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

I printed my analysis to their respective directories for each activity.
